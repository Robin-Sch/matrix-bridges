# Matrix bridges

Matrix bridges is a collection of a few [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) bridges I might use and a [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) and [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot, made with [matrix-js-sdk](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/usage-of-the-matrix-js-sdk/) and [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/).

## Installation

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
2. Create a Matrix account, for example on [Element](https://app.element.io/).
3. Create a Discord bot application on the [Discord portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
4. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`, and fill in the secrets.
5. Config files for matrix bridges aren't included, and you should figure them out yourself
